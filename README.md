# PS-GAN
# The source codes for our paper "PS-GAN: Pseudo Supervised Generative Adversarial Network with Single Scale Retinex Embedding for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion"

# inference usage:

1. Download the source codes to your machine.

2. The trained model file is "model.pt" in the folder "./checkpoint_20/model-git".

3. Run the file 'test_GAN.py" in pytorch environment to obtain fused images in the folder "./result".

4. To test your new images. please put your infrared and visible images in the folder "./dataset/IR" and "./dataset/VIS", respectively. Then go back to step 3. 

Actually, you can test it with other type of images, such as medical images. It still works Have fun!
Enjoy :beers: !!!
