The source codes here accompany the paper "PSCM-GAN: Pseudo-Supervised, Salient
 Object-Aware, Contrast-Enhanced, and Modal-Adaptive Generative Adversarial Network
 for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion" submitted to IEEE TCSVT.

# usage:

1. Download the source codes to your machine.

2. The trained model file is "model.pt" in the folder "./checkpoint_20/model-git".

2. Run the file 'test_GAN.py" in pytorch environment to obtain fused images in the folder "./result".

3. To test your new images. please put your infrared and visible images in the folder "./dataset/IR" and "./dataset/VIS", respectively. Then go to above step 2. 

Enjoy!!!
